WebMD is aware. I‚Äôve contacted them and they responded, but they‚Äôve done nothing! Unless they fix it, trust me, it‚Äôs not worth your time!!!!!",-

US,06/07/2020,width: 19%;,"Since the last update over a week ago the app has become painfully slow, taking a full ten minutes at least, to check off a few pills as taken.  The screen freezes constantly every time you touch it then you have to wait forever for it to move just a centimeter when sliding left in the pill reminder section or anywhere you tap in the app.  A constant spinning icon in the middle of the screen with every tap.  And now it has started to heat up my phone when I try to marked all pills as taken at one time because it‚Äôs so painful to visit the app several times a day.  Time to ditch this app and find another pill tracker.  I emailed support over a week ago and they‚Äôre aware of the issue because they responded, but nothing has been done.  It worked fine until the last update.  Now it‚Äôs useless to me.  Very slowwwww and buggy.  Time to find a new one.  üëé",8.8

US,05/29/2020,width: 39%;,"Since the last update of this app on my iPhone it freezes every time I hit one of the buttons. It takes at least 60 seconds to load between when I press the button on my iPhone screen to win it registers so that I can check  off that I have taken my medication. I know it‚Äôs not my phone, because no other app has this problem. Please fix this version. I am going to stop checking in the fact that I have taken my medication but keeping the app so that I have the note to vacations pop-up to remind me to take them. But as of right now, the app is more junk than it is usable",8.8
