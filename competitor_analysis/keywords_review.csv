4,Great Britain,06/05/2020,1,"Staffed by brand new baby GPs with no ability to do risk assessment and a tick box mentality. ‘But my flowchart says .....’ 
Terrible. Impossible to get repeat predictions set up (they want to keep making you book appointments as that increases payments) and you only get a 3 day window between scrips so if your can’t get to the chemist, well that’s just too bad. Now need to figure out how to get a proper GP instead of this investor focussed non patient-centric rubbish. Would give zero stars if I could.",4.22.0,babylon_itunes
114,Great Britain,04/22/2020,5,"After hurting myself I used the Babylon app to book a appointment with a doctor via video conferencing. Within a hour I was contacted and warned by text message 10 minutes beforehand. The service was remarkable and efficient. After being assessed , an online prescription was ready  for me to collect at my local pharmacy. The all experience was very reassuring and I cannot recommend high enough the service. Especially during time of pandemic. Very professional and well designed application.",4.20.3,babylon_itunes

317,English,03/25/2020,4,"The app is pretty easy to use and has a sleek design. I would recommend having sections dedicated to listing all the medication you have been prescribed and all the summaries for your appointments, which you can search through, as I can only find this through notifications . A web app or desktop access would also be helpful.",4.18.1.36032000,babylong_gp
420,English,04/28/2020,5,"Very accurate suggestions if you can give multiple true symptoms. Then look up each potential suggested diagnosis they will list. Very helpful for me to use. Not just to read something that may confirm what I think I'm having, but can also eliminate the fear of what I think I might have.",7.8.4,webmd_gp

I dont use it often, fortunately Im pretty educates in medicine, but its great to have an immediate answer, research, education, facts, articles, even someonw live to assiat you! Plus the notifications are great! They constantly keep you in the medical loop with the latest news, explorations, diagnostics, current events with certain crisis' or even tips on how to stay healthier.
