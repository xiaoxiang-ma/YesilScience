I called again and waited in the queue and was told to wait another 3 days. Today, Wednesday 27th, the test kit had not been delivered. I called Babylon midday, half way through the call I was disconnected. 
I called Babylon again at about 6pm, joined the queue at position 11.  Then moved to 12 and then 13. I then moved up to 9. Only to go back to 10 and then 11 in the queue. What kind of queuing system is that?
Finally I got through and spoke to a very helpful man in the call centre. It took him some time to find my account details - I had to e mail him an e mail I had received from Babylon to help him. I also went into the app to try and help him find my account. Then I saw that since Friday 22nd, the despatch date for the test had been moved from Monday 18th to Thursday 21st. The man in the call centre said his system showed the despatch date was Friday the 21st. What is going on? How can despatch dates be changed in you system AFTER the original despatch date. How can the system show one date on the app and another date in your call centre?

Great Britain,04/18/2020,width: 19%;,"I was very impressed by how easy it was to book an appointment with a GP. I got an appointment at my preferred time, at very short notice. The consultations also went very smoothly. 
There are however a few glitches in the process (or app) that could be improved. Firstly, I was told that my ID papers had been verified and that I was all set to go. However, after my consultation I was informed that this was not the case and I had to contact the helpline. 
As a result my prescription as not released, causing a delay. 
When this was resolved I was told I needed another GP appointment in order to reissue the initial prescription. I do not know why this would be necessary. 
Scheduling another appointment was easy but of course leads to further delays. 
When the 2nd appointment was completed and and prescription reissued, I selected a pharmacy nearby where the prescription would be sent to. 
Having waited another day, the prescription never arrived. 
It is not clear why the prescription was not sent to the pharmacy, but regardless of the reason, there was nothing to alert me or Babylon that the prescription was not issued/never received. 
After another delay and call to the helpline, I finally managed to find another pharmacy. I asked Babylon to send the prescription here, but to no avail. When I again called the helpline I was told Babylon didn’t have a fax number for this pharmacy. Why was I not contacted and made aware of this - or simply call the pharmacy to ask for the number? Instead the prescription was stuck in limbo for a 2nd time, causing more delays. 
So whilst the GP appointments seem to work very well, it is of little use until the prescription process is ironed out.",4.20.2

Buggy and problematic - had appointment cancellation one hour before the appointment, after waiting 3weeks. They blamed it on the app

Relevant basic information not visible between departments, made me loose another appointment.
Lack of basic functions - can’t upload more than one image on condition details..in most cases this makes it absolutely useless.
Inconsistent information received from different employees - makes them look completely unorganised, makes you not trust them.
MOST IMPORTANT: DATA IS NOT CONFIDENTIAL BETWEEN YOU AND THE DOCTOR!!!!

Thank you for being there when I’ve needed you!

Only one minor downside I would say was that I was on a weekend away and my son was at home with his daddy but the doctor wouldn’t call my partner to discuss my sons problem even though he is on my account, could have still done identity checks over the phone, passports et ?

A couple of minutes after completing the call my prescription came through. I selected to send it to my local Boots. The app indicated that it had been sent but I wasn’t sure if I still needed to wait for a separate notification that it was ready to pick up. Nothing arrived in the app for at least another 30 mins so I went to Boots in the hope it was there. They had no record of the prescription. Thankfully one of their (brilliant) pharmacy team called the Babylon number, confirmed the prescription was legitimate and that the hold up was it needed to be faxed! That came as a surprise to us both: Nice modern video consultantation relying on faxes - technology from the 19th century! Not quite what I expected. However all resolved within about 30 minutes so overall much more convenient than fighting for an appointment - even a telephone consultation from my local surgery, which is closed at the weekends in any case.

I really hope it tries to decouple itself more from it and becomes less reliant on having to go to GPs.

Also one thing that was never made clear to me was, you will pay varying rates for you prescriptions. I paid £3-£5 for my prescriptions in the north, I then moved south and was spending £40-£60 for the same prescriptions, the prices vary at different pharmacies. Beware of this.
