In the past I have massively struggled to get an appointment at my local practice and when I did, I would normally have to wait almost an hour to be seen.

Great Britain,06/05/2020,1,"Staffed by brand new baby GPs with no ability to do risk assessment and a tick box mentality. ‘But my flowchart says .....’ 
Terrible. Impossible to get repeat predictions set up (they want to keep making you book appointments as that increases payments) and you only get a 3 day window between scrips so if your can’t get to the chemist, well that’s just too bad.

Whilst I understand the process,  it was understood Babylon service will be able to assist with matters as such.

Great Britain,05/27/2020,1,"I ordered the Covid Antibody test on May 16th. The App told me it was dispatched Monday May 18th. After 5 working days it had not arrived. As instructed for non delivery on the app, I contacted Babylon, was offered a call back option to avoid waiting in the queue, which I took. No one called back. I called again and waited in the queue and was told to wait another 3 days. Today, Wednesday 27th, the test kit had not been delivered. I called Babylon midday, half way through the call I was disconnected. 
I called Babylon again at about 6pm, joined the queue at position 11.  Then moved to 12 and then 13. I then moved up to 9. Only to go back to 10 and then 11 in the queue. What kind of queuing system is that?
Finally I got through and spoke to a very helpful man in the call centre. It took him some time to find my account details - I had to e mail him an e mail I had received from Babylon to help him. I also went into the app to try and help him find my account. Then I saw that since Friday 22nd, the despatch date for the test had been moved from Monday 18th to Thursday 21st. The man in the call centre said his system showed the despatch date was Friday the 21st. What is going on? How can despatch dates be changed in you system AFTER the original despatch date. How can the system show one date on the app and another date in your call centre?

How can I have confidence in the integrity of test process? This is not a rhetorical question. These are not unimportant tests. This is not the level of integrity I expected from Babylon nor from any company offering health services at any time, let alone a time like this.",4.20.6,babylon_itunes

On taking the prescription to be filled at the pharmacy I was told there was a £47 charge and exemption did not apply. £47 for eye drops is absolutely disgusting and at no point was I informed before getting the prescription filled that there would be an additional charge. Considering I pay for private health care and the Babylon GP service, I was absolutely disgusted that I then had to pay nearly £50 to have my prescription filled. I will NEVER be ordering another private prescription through Babylon again. The only reason I used the service in the first place was because it was on the weekend.

Having fast access to a friendly and professional GP via the Babylon app has always been a good experience and any prescriptions or referrals have been handled efficiently. When I did need to see a GP face to face (during lockdown), that was managed very well. 

Initially the only negative I’ve experienced was with the administration/back office functions but in the past six weeks that has improved noticeably.

Great Britain,04/24/2020,1,"Love the idea of this app/service, however the app doesn’t work correctly and make sure you read the T&Cs carefully!

The appointment time’s tend to be very early in the morning or very late at night. After staying up until 11pm using the app for the first time for an appointment, the video service would not work and the doctor could see me but I couldn’t see them. I therefore had to arrange another appointment for early in the morning the next day. Where the same problem occurred. I manage to replay the video call after the appointment in the history, however the live functionality failed.

Due to the bad experience I decided to cancel my annual subscription and requested a refund. A refund was not possible as I was out of the 14 day cancellation policy, therefore I asked customer services to reinstate my membership for the remaining of the year, that I paid for. Please see their reply below:

I wrote my symptoms down and was connected with a nurse who spoke to me for 10 minutes, was very professional and kind and gave good advice. Afterwards I had access to the notes she made during the call, and links to more information about my issue. I’m so impressed and feel that this will completely revolutionise healthcare.

I think Babylon is very useful and thoughtful, it benefits a lot of people specially the ones who need medical most",4.20.2,babylon_itunes
Great Britain,04/18/2020,1,"I was very impressed by how easy it was to book an appointment with a GP. I got an appointment at my preferred time, at very short notice. The consultations also went very smoothly. 
There are however a few glitches in the process (or app) that could be improved. Firstly, I was told that my ID papers had been verified and that I was all set to go. However, after my consultation I was informed that this was not the case and I had to contact the helpline. 
As a result my prescription as not released, causing a delay. 
When this was resolved I was told I needed another GP appointment in order to reissue the initial prescription. I do not know why this would be necessary. 
Scheduling another appointment was easy but of course leads to further delays. 
When the 2nd appointment was completed and and prescription reissued, I selected a pharmacy nearby where the prescription would be sent to. 
Having waited another day, the prescription never arrived. 
It is not clear why the prescription was not sent to the pharmacy, but regardless of the reason, there was nothing to alert me or Babylon that the prescription was not issued/never received. 
After another delay and call to the helpline, I finally managed to find another pharmacy. I asked Babylon to send the prescription here, but to no avail. When I again called the helpline I was told Babylon didn’t have a fax number for this pharmacy. Why was I not contacted and made aware of this - or simply call the pharmacy to ask for the number? Instead the prescription was stuck in limbo for a 2nd time, causing more delays. 
So whilst the GP appointments seem to work very well, it is of little use until the prescription process is ironed out.",4.20.2,babylon_itunes

Great Britain,04/15/2020,1,"We should not forget this is a MEDICAL app, so it should be very carefully designed, organised and thought-through...not at all the case..
Buggy and problematic - had appointment cancellation one hour before the appointment, after waiting 3weeks. They blamed it on the app
Unoptimised - lacks important features and thus makes app feel abandoned since 1998.
Relevant basic information not visible between departments, made me loose another appointment.
Lack of basic functions - can’t upload more than one image on condition details..in most cases this makes it absolutely useless.
Inconsistent information received from different employees - makes them look completely unorganised, makes you not trust them.
MOST IMPORTANT: DATA IS NOT CONFIDENTIAL BETWEEN YOU AND THE DOCTOR!!!! Even though they tell you it is, they have proven me it is not, as even the customer service that handled my complaint, had access to sensitive data, in fact to all patient data! I have recordings of the proof and will make it public. This app unfortunately is light years away from being what it portraits to be and honestly what it should be.

But my personal opinion is this app is amazing, every time I’ve used this service for myself and son they have been extremely helpful especially when I’ve not been able to get my son out the house

Thank you for being there when I’ve needed you!

Only one minor downside I would say was that I was on a weekend away and my son was at home with his daddy but the doctor wouldn’t call my partner to discuss my sons problem even though he is on my account, could have still done identity checks over the phone, passports et ?

Great Britain,04/11/2020,4,"The GP called somewhere between 5 and 10 mins later than the booked time but that’s not by any means unreasonably late compared with my memories of appointments at my local surgery. First attempt had no sound in either direction but the doctor “hung up” and tried again and the second attempt was fine. Video and sound perfectly good enough for the purpose. A couple of minutes after completing the call my prescription came through. I selected to send it to my local Boots. The app indicated that it had been sent but I wasn’t sure if I still needed to wait for a separate notification that it was ready to pick up. Nothing arrived in the app for at least another 30 mins so I went to Boots in the hope it was there. They had no record of the prescription. Thankfully one of their (brilliant) pharmacy team called the Babylon number, confirmed the prescription was legitimate and that the hold up was it needed to be faxed! That came as a surprise to us both: Nice modern video consultantation relying on faxes - technology from the 19th century! Not quite what I expected. However all resolved within about 30 minutes so overall much more convenient than fighting for an appointment - even a telephone consultation from my local surgery, which is closed at the weekends in any case. I am fortunate that the service is provided as a benefit with the BUPA cover from my employer.

There are other conditions that I’ve needed medicine for however and I’ve been told I need to go to a GP. 

The reason I got this app was because my surgery is so awful and getting an appointment is only doable by grappling with everyone else at 8:30 in the morning and hoping to get through to the receptionist to get an appointment for that day, none in advanced. Which isn’t great for a working life. The way this app still has to lean on the NHS is disappointing as I thought I’d be getting an alternative. 

I really hope it tries to decouple itself more from it and becomes less reliant on having to go to GPs.

Also one thing that was never made clear to me was, you will pay varying rates for you prescriptions. I paid £3-£5 for my prescriptions in the north, I then moved south and was spending £40-£60 for the same prescriptions, the prices vary at different pharmacies. Beware of this.
